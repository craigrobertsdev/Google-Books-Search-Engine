## Description

This app uses the Google Books API to allow users to search for their favourite books and save them for future reference.

Users can create an account against which their saved books will be stored and can remove them at will.

This full-stack MERN application was initially created using a REST API, but has been converted to use GraphQL. Authentication is done with JSON Web Tokens.

## Usage

This application is deployed via Heroku at https://agile-thicket-64905.herokuapp.com/.
